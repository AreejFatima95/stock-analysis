# stock-analysis

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. R

Since we have a lot of data to go through we want to make our code efficient. So instead of working hard we need to work smart.
the purpose of this analysis is to see if how major green energy stocks are doing in comparison to DAQO.

So ,One of the main things we did here was creating the three output arrays(tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices.) as arrays. Having the extra array allowed us to loop through the rows. Since we refactored the code it runs faster than the previous code.Hence saves more time and space.

#Findings

In 2017  most of the tickers had a positive return and were safe investments.Steve's parents were looking into DQ which had the greatest return of all. For the 2018 you can see that the returns were not as high, DQ made the biggest loss and the total volumes were down as well.
